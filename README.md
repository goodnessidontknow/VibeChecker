# VibeChecker

## Purpose

The United States is undergoing a crisis. Too often, Americans have not kept their vibes in check. What's worse, recent studies show that a conistently low vibe can lead to severe health complications, and even death! This problem should not persist any longer! Vibe Checker is a simple, helpful tool for the user to check their vibe readings using the latest state-of-the-art, random-number technology.

## Features

1. **Toasts and Dialogs**: Toasts and dialogs appear throughout the app for ease of use, and to provide helpful information on how to improve your vibe.
2. **Localization**: The low vibe crisis has spread to some Spanish-speaking countries recently, so the app has been translated to Spanish, so more users can interact with the app without having to learn English.
3. **RecyclerView**: Want to track your vibe checks over time? The Vibe Checker provides! Using a RecyclerView, the app saves all your vibe checks here, with indications of the quality of your vibe during checks, so you can come back to them any time you want!
4. **Internet content**: Internet resources -- such as webpages and videos -- will be included with the section of the app that gives information on how to improve your vibe.
